Website data Access
    Generally an apikey is required for you to access the douban.com
    service. Goto <http://www.douban.com/service/apikey/> for an apikey

    If you want to access some private or so called protected data, you have
    to use a authenticated oauth object, which has basic implements on the
    HTTP methods just like "GET POST PUT DELETE", to access the protected
    data, Net::Douban::OAuth can do this for you. Goto
    <http://www.douban.com/service/apidoc/auth> for more douban.com OAuth
    document.

  We don't generate XML for you
    If you want to post data to some page. Net::Douban::* can do the basic
    POST/DELETE/PUT works, but it won't generate any XML for you, so you
    have to call those methods with a (xml => $XML) argument;
