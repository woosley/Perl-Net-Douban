=head2 Roles

    $client = Net::Douban->init(Roles  => [qw/User Review/]);

B<Roles> are just individual douban  API sections. You can pass B<Roles>
to the constructure, then those sections are loaded to the object.
Avalable roles are qw/User Subject Review Collection Miniblog Note Event
Recommendation Review Doumail Tag/


=head2 Traits

Traits are special Roles, Right now just there is just a
L<Net::Douban::Traits::Gift>, you can write your own trait, refer to
L<Net::Douban::Traits::Gift> to see how to do it.

When you want to use Traits under your own namespace(that is not under
Net::Douban), you should pass it with a '+' in front of the name;

    $c = Net::Douban->init("Traits" => '+My::Trait');

=head2 res_callback

You can use your own res_callback to handle the returned
L<HTTP::Response> object by:

    $client->res_callback(sub{....});

The only argument for this callback is B<$res> return from
L<LWP::UserAgent>. By default, res_callback will return the decoded JSON
hash.

=head2 Paging

Paging is support by passing argments 'start-index' and 'max-results' to
search and get functions.
